# Overview

A calculator application made with react.  To better understand react and JavaScript I decided to create a fun application that makes a calculator.

There is only one webpage, it is a functioning calculator, I do plan on improving on it more and add to it.

I used JavaScript and CSS.

# Future Work

* One of the things that I would like to do is to add on to this and make more handy applications on different tabs.
* I would like to add more functions, specically trig functions so it is more than a scientific calculator.
* I would love to implement graphing capabilities to this calculator as well.
